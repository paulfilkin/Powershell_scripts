# Trados Studio PowerShell Toolkit Scripts

This repository contains a series of PowerShell scripts designed to automate various tasks in Trados Studio 2024. These scripts make use of the [PowerShell Toolkit modules for Trados Studio](https://github.com/RWS/Sdl-studio-powershell-toolkit), allowing you to interact with and manipulate Trados Studio resources programmatically.

## Prerequisites

Before running any of the scripts, ensure you have the following:

1. **Trados Studio 2024** installed (Professional licence is required).
2. **PowerShell Toolkit for Trados Studio** installed and properly configured.
3. Necessary modules available either in the `Modules` directory within the script's folder or in your PowerShell module path.
   - *Note*: you'll probably have to unblock files downloaded so I also created a [small script](https://github.com/paulfilkin/Powershell_scripts/blob/main/mAT_Studio_Powershell/Scripts/unblock_script.ps1) to unblock all files within a folder/subfolders to save time... might be useful.
4. Also make sure your environment variables for PSModulePath are setup to use the path to the modules.  I don't use the default windows locations for my scripts so add additional variables. My scripts check the PSModulePath for the location of the modules and then looks for a valid directory that contains the `ToolkitInitializer.psm1` module by iterating through each path you set in there.
5. You will need to use the PowerShell 5 (x86) version of Powershell for these scripts as Studio is a 32-bit application.

## Scripts Overview

### 1. `00_get-help-Studio.ps1`

This script initializes the Trados Studio environment by loading the necessary PowerShell Toolkit modules. It is a simple example demonstrating how to start with the Toolkit and display help documentation for the available commands.

- **Usage**: Run this script to load the required modules and get help for the Trados Studio Toolkit commands.
- **Main Steps**:
  - Determines the script's directory and attempts to locate the necessary modules.
  - Loads the `ToolkitInitializer` module and any other required modules based on the Trados Studio version.
  - Displays help information.

### 2. `01_create_new_TM.ps1`

This script creates a new Translation Memory (TM) within Trados Studio 2024 using user-defined parameters such as source language, target language, and TM name.

- **Usage**: Execute this script to create a new TM by following the prompts.
- **Main Steps**:
  - Prompts the user for source and target language codes and TM name.
  - Constructs the TM file name and saves it to a specified directory.
  - Creates the TM and notifies the user of its location.

### 3. `02_upgrade_TMX.ps1`

This script upgrades a TMX file to a Trados Studio Translation Memory (TM). It reads the source and target language codes from the TMX file, creates a new TM in Trados Studio, and imports the TMX content into the new TM.

- **Usage**: Run this script and provide the path to a TMX file when prompted.
- **Main Steps**:
  - Prompts the user for the location of the TMX file.
  - Extracts language codes from the TMX file.
  - Creates a new TM and imports the TMX content into it.

### 4. `03_Create_File-Based_Project.ps1`

This script automates the creation of a file-based project in Trados Studio. It uses a project template, creates the project, retrieves analysis statistics, and exports translation packages for each target language.

- **Usage**: Execute this script to create a new project based on a template and generate associated translation packages.
- **Main Steps**:
  - Prompts the user for the project name and due date.
  - Allows the user to select a project template.
  - Creates the project, retrieves analysis data, and exports translation packages.

### 5. `04_Export_TMX.ps1`

This script exports the content of an SDLTM (SDL Translation Memory) file to a TMX file. It allows the user to select the SDLTM file through a file dialog and exports it to a TMX format.

- **Usage**: Run this script to convert an SDLTM file to a TMX file.
- **Main Steps**:
  - Opens a file dialog for the user to select an SDLTM file.
  - Exports the selected SDLTM file to a TMX file.
  - Notifies the user of the export's success.

### 6. `05_SDLTM_to_Excel.ps1`

This script converts an SDLTM file into a TMX file and then uses a Python script to convert the TMX into an Excel spreadsheet. Itâ€™s useful for linguists or project managers who want to review or filter TM content in Excel.

- **Usage**: Run this script to select an SDLTM file and produce an Excel version of its contents.
- **Main Steps**:
  - Prompts the user to select an SDLTM file.
  - Converts the file to TMX.
  - Executes a Python script to transform the TMX into an Excel file.
  - Confirms successful export or shows an error if conversion fails.

### 7. `06_upgradeBitexts.ps1`

This script upgrades a bilingual XML file (bitext format) into a Trados Studio Translation Memory (SDLTM). It first converts the XML to TMX, then creates and populates an SDLTM using the Trados Studio Toolkit.

- **Usage**: Run this script to convert Bitext XML files into usable SDLTMs.
- **Main Steps**:
  - Prompts the user to select a Bitext XML file.
  - Parses the source and target content.
  - Converts the content into TMX format.
  - Prompts the user to confirm language codes.
  - Creates a new TM and imports the TMX.

## How to Run the Scripts

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `scripts` folder.
3. Run the desired script using PowerShell.

```sh
.\00_get-help-Studio.ps1
```

Alternatively use the Autohotkey solution provided in the "[Run Powershell Scripts](https://github.com/paulfilkin/AHK-scripts/tree/main/Run%20Powershell%20Scripts)" folder.

Make sure your environment is correctly set up to find the necessary modules as described in each script.
